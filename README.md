# Annoytator
GUI for annotating videos and visualizing sensor data associated with the video

This GUI is meant for annotating videos and viewing the annotations together with sensor data recorded simultaneously with the video.

So far this sensor data has been eye tracking data, recorded with the SeeTrue add-on eye tracker (2022). See https://www.seetruetechnologies.com/.

Created as part of my PhD work, to do annotations for various projects, mainly for the following publications:

> J. Koskinen, A. Huotarinen, A.-P. Elomaa, B. Zheng, and R. Bednarik, “Movement-level process modeling of microsurgical bimanual and unimanual tasks,” Int. J. Comput. Assist. Radiol. Surg., vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 305–314, Feb. 2022, doi: 10.1007/s11548-021-02537-4.

> J. Koskinen et al., “Utilizing Grasp Monitoring to Predict Microsurgical Expertise,” J. Surg. Res. (Accepted for publication), 2022.

The app is still unfinished, it only has the bare-bones functionality for loading and viewing a video frame by frame, adding new annotation labels, adding and editing annotations, viewing associated sensor data.

Will be hopefully finished one day.
